- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.0.0 or higher)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (for testing and deployment)
- Ethereum wallet with test Ether (for deploying to test networks)

## Installation

   truffle develop
   ```

2. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   compile
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   test
   ```
